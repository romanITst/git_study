NGINX homeworik

1. Install NGINX on you VM and check that it’s available on port 80.

2. Create the following folders:
- /var/www/83
- /var/www/84
- /var/www/85

3. Create config files for each of the folders with corresponding ports.

4. localhost:83 should give simple ‘Hello, World!’ page. Access logging only

5. localhost:84 should respond with code 200 and text ‘Hi from port 84!’.

6. localhost:84/files should contain pages 1.html, 2.html. (some text like ‘this is file1’
would be fine).

7. localhost:85 should display default nginx page.

8. localhost:85/login should ask you to login and then displaying page with text ‘Login
successful!’.

For this you can create a separate ‘NGINX’ folder in your github repo, containing web
pages, port config files and screenshots (not necessary) of browser requests to the paths
above.
